## 📋 Available Scripts

- `pnpm release` - Publish packages using changesets

## 🔄 Release Process

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and publishing:

1. **Create a changeset**: Run `pnpm changeset` to create a new changeset
2. **Describe your changes**: Follow the prompts to describe your changes and specify which packages are affected
3. **Commit the changeset**: Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file
4. **Release**: When ready, run `pnpm release` to publish new versions

### Changeset Requirements

All pull requests that modify code must include a changeset file. This is enforced by our CI workflow. If your PR doesn't need a changeset (e.g., documentation updates, CI changes), you can skip this requirement by adding `[skip changeset check]` to your PR title or description.

## 🛠️ Development Tools

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **tsup** - Fast TypeScript bundler
- **pnpm** - Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **Changesets** - Version management and changelog generation

## � GitHub Secrets Configuration

This repository uses several GitHub secrets for automated publishing, signing, and authentication. These secrets need to be configured in your GitHub repository settings under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

### Required Secrets

| Secret Name | Description | Used For |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private GPG key for signing commits and tags | Signing release commits and tags during automated publishing |
| `GPG_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase for the GPG private key | Unlocking the GPG key during CI operations |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions | Pushing signed commits/tags and creating release PRs |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | NPM authentication token | Publishing packages to npm registry |

### Setting up the Secrets

1. **GPG_PRIVATE_KEY**: Export your GPG private key in ASCII armor format:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export-secret-key "your-key-id" > private-key.asc
   ```
   Copy the contents of `private-key.asc` into this secret.

2. **GPG_PASSPHRASE**: The passphrase you used when creating your GPG key.

3. **BOT_TOKEN**: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with the following permissions:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   
4. **NPM_TOKEN**: Create an npm automation token:
   - Go to npmjs.com → Account → Access Tokens
   - Create a new token with "Automation" type

### Automatic Secrets

The following secrets are automatically provided by GitHub and don't need manual configuration:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions for repository operations

### Security Notes

- Never commit these secrets to your repository
- Regularly rotate your tokens and keys
- Use the principle of least privilege when setting up token permissions
- Monitor your repository's security audit logs for any unauthorized access
